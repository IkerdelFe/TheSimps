        <button class="accordion">Who is Homer Simpson?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>  
          I'm a man of simple but defined tastes. My perfect day includes an ice-cold Duff Beer, a box of pink donuts, and a TV show that doesn't make me think too hard. I consider myself a couch potato, where I've left the mark of my anatomy after countless hours staring at the screen.
          Physically, I'm not what you'd call "fit"; my prominent abdomen is a testament to my devotion to culinary pleasures. My bald head retains only two strands of hair and a zigzag line, distinctive features I've come to accept over the years. I have a weakness for the easy, the comfortable, and the immediate. Patience is not my virtue, nor is moderation. I enjoy singing in the shower, carelessly scratching myself, and letting my impulses guide my decisions, for better or worse. Although many people consider me simple, I have my moments of brilliance... they are rare, but they do exist.

        <button class="accordion">Personal life</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            My family... well, they are everything to me, even if I don't always show it like I should.
          </br>
          </br>
            Marge is my pillar, my rock. From the moment I met her in high school, I knew she was special. She's put up with my craziness for decades, always supporting me even when I wouldn't believe in myself. Sometimes I wonder what she saw in me and why she's still by my side after all my mistakes.
          </br>
          </br>
            Bart is my little delinquent. We're more alike than I'd like to admit, and even though I spend a lot of time strangling him (D'oh!), I see myself reflected in him. I worry about his future, but secretly admire his rebellious spirit.
            Lisa... my brilliant Lisa. It's a mystery how someone so smart came from me. I don't always understand her interests or concerns, but I'm immensely proud of her. Sometimes I feel inadequate as a parent to someone so extraordinary.
            And Maggie, my eternal baby. Silent but observant. I worked at the nuclear plant specifically so I could support her when she was born. Even though we don't talk much, there's a special bond between us.
          </br>
          </br>
            I know I'm not the best father or the best husband. I've failed more times than I can count. But when I see my children grow and Marge smile, I feel like, somehow, I'm doing something right.
            At the end of the day, when everyone is asleep and the house is quiet, I realize I'd give everything for them. They're the only truly good thing I've done in this life. And if I could stop time, I'd do it right in one of those moments when we're all together, simply being a family.

        <button class="accordion">Professional career</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>My career has been as varied as it has been chaotic, but it can be summarized in two main stages:         </br>
          </br>          
          <h3>Springfield's nuclear plant</h3>
          <p>I am the safety supervisor in Sector 7G of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. While my career path has been uneven, I have held this position for decades, supporting my family despite the constant financial hardships and challenges of working under Mr. Burns.
            I am not a man of grand ambitions or exceptional talents. I recognize my intellectual limitations and my tendency to take the easy way out. I have made countless mistakes, but I have always tried to remedy them, especially when they affect those I love.
            Perhaps my greatest strength is my ability to find happiness in the simple things: a cold beer, a good meal, a quiet moment on the couch. In a complex world, I have learned to value these small, everyday pleasures.
            At the end of the day, I am just an ordinary man trying to make the best of the cards I have been dealt.            
                  </br>   </br>
          <h3>Other jobs</h3>
          <p>
            I've also held countless jobs throughout my life. I was an astronaut for NASA, although I nearly caused a disaster on the space mission. I've worked as a sugar salesman, a snowplow entrepreneur, a conceptual artist, a mayor's bodyguard, a gravedigger, a missionary, a bartender, a truck driver, and even briefly served as Springfield's Health Commissioner.
            In the culinary world, I operated a food stand, was a food critic for "The Springfield Shopper," and even owned my own food truck. I also dabbled in the arts as the lead singer of the Solfamidas, where we even won a Grammy.
            My time in sports includes being an umpire, a mascot for the Springfield baseball team, and a professional boxer. I tried my hand at inventing my toilet seat, became an automobile designer for my half-brother Herb Powell, and founded my own religion.
            Despite this uneven path, I always return to the Nuclear Power Plant. Not because it's my passion, but because it represents the stability my family needs. Each of these jobs, no matter how absurd or brief, has taught me something about myself and what truly matters: being able to provide for Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, even if it means returning to the grind under the watchful eye of Mr. Burns.
